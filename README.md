# post_process

Post process code generated by OpenAPI Generator.

Often, you want to slightly modify the code generated by OpenAPI Generator with a few find and replace tasks.

`post_process` automates this process with a configuration file.

It might support more task types in the future.

## Installation

### Install from Git

Add the following to shard.yaml

```yaml
development_dependencies:
  post_process:
    github: cyangle/post_process
    version: ~> 0.2.1
```

## Usage

Run `post_process` binary within your project to find and replace strings with regex patterns.

## Configuration

Default configuration file is `.post_process.yml`.
It allows to configure multiple find and replace tasks.

All changes are applied sequentially in the order specified in the configuration file.

Example configuration file:

```yaml
tasks: # Required, an array of find and replace tasks.
  - name: "update api files" # Required, name of the task.
    file_glob: './src/google_drive/api/*.cr' # Required, file path glob pattern for the files to be processed.
    changes: # Required, an array of changes you want to make to the files
      -
        name: 'Remove common method prefix "drive_[api_name]_"' # Required, name of the change
        pattern: 'drive_%{api_name}_' # Required, string template for the regex pattern to find strings to change, supports interpolation.
        new_value: '' # Required, string template for the new string to replace the ones found by the pattern, supports interpolation.
        multi_line: false # Optional, whether to match multiple lines, default to false.
      -
        name: 'Restore operation name' # Required, name of the change
        pattern: 'operation: "%{capitalized_api_name}Api.' # Required, string template for the regex pattern to find strings to change, supports interpolation.
        new_value: 'operation: "%{capitalized_api_name}Api.drive_%{api_name}_' # Required, string template for the new string to replace the ones found by the pattern, supports interpolation.

```

For each file, before processing, `pattern` and `new_value` would be interpolated with below two variables:

- `api_name`
- `capitalized_api_name`

Given example file path `src/google_drive/api/files_api.cr`, the `api_name` for this file is `files`, and the `capitalized_api_name` for this file is `Files`.

the above configuration file after interpolation:

```yaml
tasks: # Required, an array of find and replace tasks.
  - name: "update api files" # Required, name of the task.
    file_glob: './src/google_drive/api/files_api.cr' # Required, file path glob pattern for the files to be processed.
    changes: # Required, an array of changes you want to make to the files
      -
        name: 'Remove common method prefix "drive_[api_name]_"' # Required, name of the change
        pattern: 'drive_files_' # Required, string template for the regex pattern to find strings to change, supports interpolation.
        new_value: '' # Required, string template for the new string to replace the ones found by the pattern, supports interpolation.
        multi_line: false # Optional, whether to match multiple lines, default to false.
      -
        name: 'Restore operation name' # Required, name of the change
        pattern: 'operation: "FilesApi.' # Required, string template for the regex pattern to find strings to change, supports interpolation.
        new_value: 'operation: "FilesApi.drive_files_' # Required, string template for the new string to replace the ones found by the pattern, supports interpolation.

```

## Development
